The problem is, from our experience, that most of the AI courses are, let's say, too technical. Learning about coding or some programming languages... seriously?! You really don't need to know that the same way as you don't need to know how a car works to drive it. We wanted to change this paradigm. As pedagogues with 10+ years of experience in teaching, our mission is to teach the real stuff and in a creative way. Students aren't getting any smarter with the unending ChatGPT \"cheating\" on any schoolwork they get, so we would like to focus on a few key points in this topic. It's crucial to integrate AI into education in a way that enhances learning without overwhelming everyone with technical jargon. By focusing on practical applications and real-world examples, we can make AI more accessible and engaging. We aim to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills rather than just offering shortcuts for assignments."
