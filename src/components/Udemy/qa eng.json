It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest. The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements. Some prefer saying Software testing as a White Box and Black Box Testing. In simple terms, Software Testing means the Verification of Application Under Test (AUT). This tutorial introduces testing software to the audience and justifies its importance."
